The example of my code on CodeWars could be found bellow

        function spinWords(string){
        if (string.indexOf(' ')){
        let arr=string.split(" ");
        for (let i=0; i<arr.length; i++) {
            if (String(arr[i]).length>=5){
            arr[i]=String(arr[i]).split('').reverse().join(''); 
            }
        }  return arr.join(' ');
            } else { if (string.length>=5){
            string=string.split('').reverse().join('');
            return string;
        }
        }
